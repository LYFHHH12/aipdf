## This project is based on React and requires an OpenAI API key.
Due to OpenAI's security policies, I cannot include my personal API key in the repository.

## If you want to test this code in your local environment,
please use your own OpenAI API key in the `.env` file or email me to get mine.

## Firstly, because all of the code is javascript and based on React, you need to download node.js to get npm command.
